    <h1>About CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used for describing the presentation and styling of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.
    <ul>
        <li>Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. Selectors can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.</li>
        <li>Style properties: CSS properties define how elements should be styled. Examples of CSS properties include color, font-size, width, height, margin, padding, and background.</li>
        <li>Cascading and specificity: CSS follows a cascading model, where styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden by more specific styles. Specificity is a rule that determines which styles should take precedence when multiple rules target the same element. It is based on the type of selector used, inline styles, IDs, classes, and other factors.</li>
